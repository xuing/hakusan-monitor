# Hakusan Monitor — Overall Design

Companion to `PLAN.md`. Covers the data flow, API contract, normalization rules,
current UI structure, visual language, and i18n model.

## 1. Data flow & normalization

```
scontrol -o show nodes ────────────┐
squeue -h -a -o <fmt> ─────────────┼─▶ sources.py parse ─▶ normalize.py ─▶ latest snapshot ─▶ /api/snapshot
squeue -O tres/SchedNodes/Container┤                            │                       └─▶ /api/stream
sacct pending ReqTRES ─────────────┘                            │
sbatch --test-only CPU probes ─▶ probe cache ──────────────────┤
sacctmgr/scontrol partition ─▶ policy cache ───────────────────┤
login-node /proc/df/iostat/ps ─▶ login sampler ────────────────┤
                                                               └─▶ store.py SQLite ─▶ history / usage APIs
```

Normalization rules (the important correctness bits):
- **Dedupe nodes** by `name` from `scontrol show nodes` — never sum `sinfo`
  partition rows (partitions overlap the same physical nodes).
- **Node pools** (physical hardware groups) are derived from node-name prefix +
  gres, independent of the many logical partitions:
  `cpu` (`lcpcc-*`), `a40`, `a100`, `vm-cpu` (`spcc-cld-NN`), `h100-80`
  (`spcc-cld-gl*`), `h100-20c` (`spcc-cld-g09..12`), `lm` (`spcc-cld-lm*`).
- **GPU counting** parses `gres` / `gres_used`: `gpu:<type>:<n>(...)` → totals and
  used per type. Free = total − used.
- **State bucketing:** map raw Slurm states → `{allocated, mixed, idle, down,
  drain, reserved}`. A node is "available" if idle/mixed and not drain/down.
- **Queue:** group `squeue` jobs by `state` (RUNNING/PENDING) and `partition`;
  tally `state_reason` for pending; extract per-job GPU ask from `tres_req_str`.
- **Pressure score** per partition ∈ [0,1]:
  `0.6 * util + 0.4 * min(pending/(running+1), 1)`
  where `util` = GPU util for GPU partitions else CPU util. Buckets:
  `<0.5 low · <0.75 moderate · <0.9 high · ≥0.9 critical`.

## 2. API contract

Backend serves the SPA (static) **and** JSON endpoints. All localizable values are
**stable enum keys**, never prose.

- `GET /api/snapshot` — the whole normalized snapshot.
- `GET /api/stream` — SSE updates whenever a new snapshot is sampled.
- `GET /api/history?hours=24` — down-sampled cluster history.
- `GET /api/login-nodes` — current Hakusan 1 / Hakusan 2 login-node health.
- `GET /api/login-nodes/history?hours=24` — down-sampled login-node history.
- `GET /api/usage?days=30` — hour-of-day and weekday usage patterns.
- `GET /api/health` — `{ok, source, stale, age_s}`.
- `GET /api/meta` — cluster name, slurm version, partitions catalog, container
  info (static + detected).

}
```

## 3. UI structure

The React app is route-based rather than one giant dashboard:

- **Overview**: resource-filtered KPIs, hardware pools, occupants, pending jobs,
  quick request commands, releases, queue insights, down nodes, and top users.
- **Partitions**: policy-aware partition rows grouped by physical pool, including
  CPU `sbatch --test-only` predictions and copyable commands when available.
- **Analytics**: 24 h trends and hour/weekday usage patterns from SQLite rollups.
- **Login nodes**: Hakusan 1 / 2 load, iowait, memory, disk pressure, users, and
  top processes.
- **Nodes / Jobs**: TanStack raw-data tables with search, facets, column toggles,
  pagination, and node/job expansion details.
- **Guides**: Slurm, Containers, and Project Description pages.

## 4. Visual language

- **Dark, control-room aesthetic** (HPC ops feel), light mode available.
- Palette: bg `#0c1018`, panel `#151b26`, line `#222c3a`, text `#e6edf6`,
  muted `#8a97a8`. Accent `#4cc2ff` (Hakusan blue). Load ramp green→amber→red:
  `#3fb950 / #d29922 / #f85149`; "full/critical" pulses subtly.
- Type: system UI stack + `ui-monospace` for numbers/IDs. Big tabular-nums for KPIs.
- Charts use small owned SVG components; compact inline bars and status dots are
  hand-built in React/Tailwind. This keeps the production bundle predictable.
- Accessibility: levels carry text labels + ARIA, not color alone; ≥4.5:1 contrast.

## 5. i18n keys (excerpt)

```
app.title, app.subtitle, refresh.in, refresh.now, updated.ago,
kpi.cpu, kpi.gpu, kpi.nodes, kpi.queue, kpi.running, kpi.pending,
nodes.up, nodes.busy, nodes.down,
gpu.board, gpu.free, gpu.full, gpu.maint,
helper.title, helper.instant, helper.short, helper.long, helper.copy, helper.none,
part.pressure, level.low, level.moderate, level.high, level.critical,
reason.Resources, reason.Priority, reason.QOSMaxCpuPerJobLimit, reason.Other,
queue.insights, queue.longestWait, queue.reasons, trend.title,
container.title, container.version, container.module, container.examples,
container.gotchas, container.jobs,
cheatsheet.title, cheatsheet.slurm, cheatsheet.conda, cheatsheet.singularity,
cheatsheet.cuda, footer.disclaimer, footer.source, lang.name
```

Three locale files: `en.ts`, `ja.ts`, `zh.ts`. Enum-key labels
(`state.*`, `level.*`, `reason.*`, `pool.*`) live in each locale so the backend
stays language-neutral.

## 6. As built — deltas from this design

- **Collection is compact, not `--json`.** `sources.py` runs `scontrol -o show
  nodes` + `squeue -h -a -o '<fmt>'` (+ singularity) in **one SSH round trip**
  over a reused `ControlMaster` connection, and parses the text into the same
  `{nodes:[…]}` / `{jobs:[…]}` shapes this design assumed — so `normalize.py` is
  unchanged. Payload ~210 KB vs ~17 MB. Rationale: keep the login node light.
- **Real-time via SSE + SQLite TSDB.** `store.py` keeps raw samples plus hourly
  rollups. A background sampler pushes to SSE subscribers and records history in
  one step.
- **Added endpoints:** `GET /api/stream` (SSE), `GET /api/history`,
  `GET /api/usage` (peak/trough), alongside `/api/snapshot`, `/api/meta`,
  `/api/health`.
- **GPU board carries `down`/`maint`** so a type whose nodes are offline (e.g.
  H100-MIG) shows *maintenance*, never a misleading "free".
- **Scheduler reservations are not outages.** Idle GPUs on `PLANNED` or other
  scheduler-blocked nodes are reported as `reserved`; only GPUs on nodes that
  need operator attention contribute to `down`.

## 7. v2 — React frontend (shadcn/ui + owned SVG charts)

The frontend was rebuilt as a React + TypeScript app (`web/`) — the backend API
is the stable contract, so nothing server-side changed except the new raw-data
endpoints.

- **Stack:** Vite · Tailwind v3 · **shadcn/ui** (owned, copy-in Radix primitives)
  · owned responsive SVG charts · **Radix Colors** dark scales · TanStack Table
  · react-router. One unified dark theme maps semantic status tokens onto the
  high-contrast Radix palette (`web/src/index.css` + `tailwind.config.js`).
- **Subsystems (one folder each):** `layout/` (sidebar + topbar shell, language
  switcher, live indicator, resource filter), `dashboard/` (all the live widgets),
  `data/` (reusable TanStack `DataTable` + node/job column defs), `analytics/`
  (usage heatmap + SVG trends), `charts/` (owned chart primitives), `common/` +
  `ui/` (shared + shadcn primitives).
- **Data flow:** a single SSE connection in a `LiveProvider` context feeds every
  widget (`useLive`); table/history/usage views fetch via `useApi`; a
  `ResourceFilterProvider` holds the All/CPU/GPU-type lens.
- **i18n:** `en.ts` is the source of truth for the key set; `ja.ts`/`zh.ts` are
  `Record<TranslationKey, string>` so a missing key fails the type-check.
- **Routing & bundle:** pages are `React.lazy`-split; removing the general chart
  vendor avoids loading a large dependency for two compact charts.

## 8. v3 — pools-first model (correctness + user value)

User testing exposed that leading with Slurm **partitions** is wrong: Hakusan's
25 partitions are overlapping views of ~7 physical pools (16 CPU partitions = the
same 124 `lcpcc` nodes), so the UI showed "124 nodes / 1.5 TB / 0 free nodes"
sixteen times. Verified every aggregate against `sinfo` — the numbers were exact;
the **framing** was the bug.

- **Hardware pools are the primary entity.** `normalize.py` builds one pool per
  physical group (`cpu`, `vm-cpu`, `lm`, `a40`, `a100`, `h100-80`, `h100-20c`)
  with node-state breakdown, **free cores** (idle cores on mixed nodes — the real
  "can I run" number, not idle whole nodes), GPUs-by-type with `next_free`/`maint`,
  the partitions that submit to it, per-pool queue (R/PD/releasing), an `avail`
  summary, and **`occupants`** — the running jobs (user · GPU/CPU · node · time
  left) so you can see *who is using the H100/A100 right now*.
- **The resource filter transforms the view.** Picking a pool re-scopes the KPI
  cards (e.g. A100 → GPUs used/free, A100 nodes, A100 queue) and the pools/lists,
  instead of repeating cluster-wide CPU/GPU numbers.
- Load bars now reflect real per-pool utilization (VM-CPU 0%, A100 100%), so they
  no longer read as "all red".

## 9. v4 — refinements (raw/derived split, node view, full occupancy)

- **One pull feeds everything.** The SSE snapshot now carries the **raw** `nodes`,
  `jobs` and a `part_pool` map alongside the derived view. The Nodes/Jobs tables
  and the per-pool occupancy all *derive* from this single payload client-side
  (`lib/derive.ts`) — no more separate `/api/nodes` · `/api/jobs` polling. Raw
  (server-provided) and derived (computed here) are cleanly separated.
- **The "All" KPIs are node-centric**, not core-centric: total available nodes,
  **GPU nodes free** and **CPU nodes free** (each with a bar). Picking a pool still
  swaps the KPIs to that pool's own numbers.
- **"Who's using it" shows everyone** — every running job on the pool, in a
  scrollable list with a per-job **search filter** and a **share bar** per row.
- **The helper respects the filter** — choosing H100 recommends H100 (and says
  "will queue" if it's full) instead of redirecting you to a CPU pool.
- Free cores exclude down/drained nodes, so they equal `sinfo`'s idle value exactly.
- **Node-level occupancy**: each row of the Nodes table expands to show the jobs
  running *on that node* (user · job id · GPU/CPU · time left), via a Slurm
  hostlist expander (`expandHostlist`) over the raw jobs. Most-active-users now
  carry a share bar.
